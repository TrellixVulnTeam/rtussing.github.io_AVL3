                    This website is a personal project of mine. I created it to use as a display for the work I've 
                    done, as well as a platform to experiment with web development. I've enjoyed the creative process of 
                    designing websites since I was first introduced to it in high school, and I find it satisfying to bring 
                    my concepts to life. Please take the time to look through it, let me know what you think, and reach out 
                    if you have any questions!

                    The robot design project was a semester long project for the second semester of OSU's Fundamentals 
                    of Engineering Honors class. Along with three teammates, I designed, constructed, programmed, and tested 
                    a robot (shown to the left) to move through a course and complete tasks in a fictional diner.
                    <br><br>
                    This was an intensive project, and it required several hundred hours as a team to complete. There is 
                    detailed documentation on the robot scenario, as well as the entire design process, available on our 
                    *<a href="https://u.osu.edu/feh22g5/" target="_blank">Robot Project Website</a>. As a whole, it provided a great chance to 
                    learn about managing a project and working with a team in a long-term, engineering setting.
                    <br><br>
                    *Currently, Ohio State does not allow the project website to be accessed publicly. If you are 
                    interested in seeing the project in full, please contact me.

                    The MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge, a.k.a. the M3 Challenge, is a yearly event hosted by SIAM and 
                    sponsored by MathWorks. In this event, teams of students are given a real-world problem to solve with 
                    limited time and resources. Students compete for $100,000 in prize money, and the entire event provides an 
                    opportunity to experience the applications of mathematics. More information can be found 
                    <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    I competed in this event twice as a high school student (2020 and 2021). From my experience, it is an 
                    extremely difficult event and one that forced me to work quickly and creatively. Although we never won
                    a prize, the competition was a great chance for my teammates and I to learn about the process of researching
                    and solving complex problems.
